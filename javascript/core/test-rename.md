# Perform and manage asynchronous operations in JavaScript

slug: js.async

## Description
This standard specifically deals with writing code to perform asynchronous operations. Any time code awaits some asynchronous event before being run. It does not deal with _reasoning_ about asynchronous operations, except insofar as one must reason about the JavaScript-specific implementation details and considerations.

## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recording for each of the following objectives:

- Use callbacks to asynchronously execute code
- Explain the event loop in JavaScript
- Use Promises to perform sequential asynchronous operations
- Use `async` and `await` to create asynchronously resolving generator functions
