## Assessment Requirements
In order to fully cover this standard, a performance must be recorded for each of the following objectives:

0. Find the conditional probability of A given B as the fraction of B’s outcomes that also belong to A, and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
1. Apply the Addition Rule, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A and B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
2. Apply the general Multiplication Rule in a uniform probability model, P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
3. Apply the Law of Total Probability, P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and B’), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.  
4. Apply the conditional probability of A given B as P(A and B)/P(B), and determine independence of A and B as situations in which the conditional probability of A given B is the same as the probability of A, and the conditional probability of B given A is the same as the probability of B.
